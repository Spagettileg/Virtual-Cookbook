# 3rd Milestone Project | Virtual Cookbook
Data-Centric Development - Code Institute 

Virtual Cookbook has been designed for people of all cooking capabilities to help produce delicious and wholesome meals. This application provides quick and intuitive access to recipes borne out of selected food genres.

If you are struggling for time to cook, notice on preparation and cooking time is made clear. Diet conscious consumers can view the calories per serving numbers to help plan for the right recipe.

Finally, you can add new recipes to this application by simply clicking on 'Add Recipe' at the top of the screen. Favourite recipes can be recorded, existing recipes can be edited and unwanted recipes can be deleted. All at the users fingertips.

### Responsiveness & Rendering

## Browser Compatability

The following browsers were used in testing the Virtual Cookbook application. Internet Explorer was out of scope for testing due to obsolete capability

platform | version
---------|--------
Chrome   |76.0.3809.132
Edge     |44.18362.267.0

## Deployment

### Deployment to Heroku
The site has been formally deployed to [Heroku](https://pbf-third-milestone-project.herokuapp.com/) and the latest version of my application can be found here. The following steps were taken in order to deploy:

#### AWS Cloud 9 IDE
- I created a secret_key within .bashrc and heroku so I could still run the project from my own IDE and the security of the password be preserved
- MongoDB Atlas, upon creation of a cluster & database, created a connection string to be copied into both .bashrc and heroku
- Flask debugging turned off by setting debug=False
- Requirements.txt file created with the command `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. This is essential
- Procfile created withthe command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- Push all my latest production ready code to GitHub ready for deployment via Heroku's GitHub function where you can deploy from GitHub the production ready app

#### Heroku
- From the Heroku dashboard I created a new app, using the name cheers-drinksdb and set the region to Europe
- In the settings tab I clicked reveal config vars and entered the required environment variables, which in this case were:
    - Key = IP, Value = 0.0.0.0
    - Key = PORT, Value = 5000
    - Key = SECRET, Value = ************
    - Key = MONGO_URI, Value = mongodb+srv:\\root:passwordatmyfirstcluster-52qvv.mongodb.net/virtual_cookbook?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    - On the deploy tab, in the Deployment method section I chose deploy from AWS Cloud 9 IDE via command `git push heroku master`

#### Local Deployment
##### Via GitHub
- Manually download the application locally to your machine and then upload to your preferred IDE
- Install the projects requirements.txt using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- A few environment variables need to be updated before you can run the app:
    - `app.secret_key = os.getenv("SECRET")` 
    - `app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.getenv("MONGO_URI")`
    - `app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = "virtual_cookbook"`
- Once the above steps are complete you can try run the application using `python3 recipe.py`

##### Via the CLI
- Clone my repo via Git using the following command `https://github.com/Spagettileg/pbf-third-milestone-project.git`
- Install the projects requirements.txt using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- A few environment variables need to be updated before you can run the app:
    - `app.secret_key = os.getenv("SECRET")` 
    - `app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.getenv("MONGO_URI")`
    - `app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = "virtual_cookbook"`
- Once the above steps are complete you can try run the application using `python3 recipe.py` 

## Credits

### Content
All code content in this software was written by me, with the expection of the following:
- Reformatting of [Textarea](https://alistapart.com/article/expanding-text-areas-made-elegant/) was supported by code sourced from Neil Jenkins. Under normal circumatances, HTML & CSS are not geared up for responsive formatting of textarea, hence a specialist Javascript code snippet was found and implemented.   
- [User registration](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_form_steps.asp) code snippet sourced from W3Schools.com. Additional formatting and creation of required attributes was written by myself.
